## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notetaker_transcriber.git
cd notetaker_transcriber

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install system dependencies (macOS)
brew install ffmpeg portaudio
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Simple transcription
python src/transcribe_m4a.py "audio.m4a"

# Enhanced transcription with better model
python src/enhanced_transcriber.py "audio.m4a" "output.txt"

# Ensemble transcription (maximum accuracy)
python src/ensemble_transcriber.py "audio.m4a" "output.txt"
```

## 🎤 Voice Adaptation

### Create Voice Profile

```bash
# Create a voice profile from your recordings
python src/custom_training_transcriber.py create-profile "voice1.m4a" "voice2.m4a"

# Transcribe with voice adaptation
python src/custom_training_transcriber.py transcribe "new_audio.m4a"
```

### Prepare Training Data

```bash
# Prepare data for custom model training
python src/custom_training_transcriber.py prepare-training \
  "audio1.m4a" "transcript1.txt" \
  "audio2.m4a" "transcript2.txt"
```

## 📊 Accuracy Comparison

Compare different transcription methods:

```bash
python src/compare_transcriptions.py "audio.m4a"
```

**Typical Results:**
- **Basic Vosk**: 876 words, 80/100 quality score
- **Enhanced (0.22 model)**: 1067 words, 100/100 quality score  
- **Ensemble (multiple models)**: 1074 words, 100/100 quality score
